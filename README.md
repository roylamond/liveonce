# LiveOnce 2026

**LiveOnce** is a long-running football and travel tradition that began with a group tour to the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and has continued through periodic reunions and trips. In 2026, the group marks the **20-year anniversary** of the original tour during the FIFA World Cup in North America.

This repository contains the source files for the **LiveOnce website**, which serves two purposes:

1. A **permanent public archive** of past LiveOnce trips  
2. A **central information hub** for the planned LiveOnce 2026 events
